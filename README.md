### Testing webscraping using a static site

The demo webpage is provided by the Pluralsight course "Web Scraping: Python Data Playbook" by Ian Ozsvald. 

In order to produce replicable result the website that will be used is the auto_mpg.html page. 

This can be easily served by using a local server by running "python3 -m http.server"  which will allow us to access all files over localhost.
